## 📝 Project Description
This project is a **Student Management System** built entirely with **Vanilla JavaScript**. It demonstrates how to manipulate data structures without external libraries.

The system manages a list of student objects and performs **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, along with advanced data analysis using `filter`, `sort`, and `reduce`.

### ✨ Features
* ✅ **Create:** Add new students with strict validations (No duplicates, valid age/gender).
* ✅ **Read:** View all students or search for a specific student by ID.
* ✅ **Update:** Modify existing student details while keeping the ID locked.
* ✅ **Delete:** Remove students safely using array filtering.
* ✅ **Advanced Sorting:** Sort students alphabetically (A-Z).
* ✅ **Analytics:** Find the oldest student and count students by grade.
