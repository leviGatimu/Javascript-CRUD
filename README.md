# Student Management System (JavaScript Arrays CRUD)

A pure JavaScript Student Management System developed to demonstrate proficiency in Array manipulation, CRUD operations, filtering, and sorting logic.

## 📋 Project Description
This project manages a list of students using an array of objects. It follows a strict "No External Libraries" and "No Express" rule, focusing entirely on core JavaScript logic and console-based output.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your computer.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved.
4. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   node "JS final.js"
🛠️ Features
Create: Add students with strict validation (checks for empty names, valid age, gender, and duplicate entries).

Read: Retrieve the full list of students or find a specific student by their unique ID.

Update: Modify existing student data while ensuring the ID remains unchanged.

Delete: Remove students from the system with a confirmation message.

Filter & Sort:

Filter students by gender (Male).

Sort students alphabetically by name.

Identify the oldest student using .reduce().

Count the total number of students in Grade 11.

📺 Presentation Video
In this video, I explain the logic behind the CRUD functions and the array methods used (push, find, filter, sort, reduce).

📸 Project Screenshots
Note: As this project is built without a server (No Express), screenshots demonstrate the system output in the VS Code Terminal.

🧠 Array Methods Used
push(): For adding new student objects to the array.

find(): For retrieving a specific student and checking for duplicates.

filter(): For deleting students and filtering by gender or grade.

sort(): For alphabetizing the student list.

reduce(): For calculating the oldest student in the array.
